Vertical beams = 73.5" x2 1/8in thick 3x3 steel tubing

Horizontal beam = 57" 1/8in thick 3x6 steel tubing

trusses = 30" x6 1/8in thick 2x2 steel tubing

base feet = 30' x2 1/8in thick 3x3 steel tubing

bottom + top beams = 63" x2 1/8in thick 3x3 steel tubing

30 + 30 + 63 + 63 + 73.5 + 73.5 = 30' of 3x3in steel

57 3x6 = 5' of 3x6in steel

16' of 2x2in steel

30' of 2x2in steel for gussets and top truss
